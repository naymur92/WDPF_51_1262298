Until the onset of the current macroeconomic challenges, the story of macroeconomic stability in Bangladesh over the past one and a half decades included sustained and rising economic growth, low volatility of economic growth, keeping the budget deficit at around five percent of GDP, favourable current account balance, a declining share of foreign aid in the gross national income (GNI), low level of external debt as a percentage of GNI,

overall robust growth of exports and remittances, growing foreign exchange reserves, manageable inflationary pressure, a stable exchange rate, a high level of installed capacity of electricity, and reasonably stable private investment regime. The list is long. Not many developing countries have enjoyed such macroeconomic stability for a long time in recent years. Even when the Covid pandemic affected the economy, poverty, and labour market in Bangladesh, the macroeconomic stability was not affected much. The government was able to run a large stimulus package.

However, there is the other side of the coin, too. Despite the macroeconomic success, Bangladesh faces several long-standing challenges, which include a very low tax-GDP ratio, a high degree of non-performing loans and weak governance in the banking sector, very low level of foreign direct investment (FDI), misalignment of exchange rate hurting export promotion and export diversification, high cost of doing business, lack of export diversification, sluggish employment growth, slow progress in private sector investment, a large amount of illicit outward money transfer, high amount of subsidies in the annual budget, and inefficiency in budget implementation.
